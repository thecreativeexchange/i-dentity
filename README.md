# i-dentity
A digital party game based on traditional play and games which has been used as a tool to explore movement based games and an ice breaker for creative play practitioners, youth workers and academic workshops.

The game was originally conceived at the Game Jam at CHI '13.

The following is the CHI 2014 paper and study led by Exertion Games Lab, RMIT about i-dentity in its role as a tool:

4. Madgwick - this is not included in the source tree and the game is currently setup on a define to run without it.
However, Madgwick allows better construction of the quaternion so the controllers can take into account the affect of gravity.
Download http://www.x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/ from here, add the define and experiment.

Special thanks to Thomas Perl and his PS Move API who without this game would not be possible.
