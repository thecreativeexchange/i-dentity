# i-dentity
A digital party game based on traditional play and games which has been used as a tool to explore movement in games and an ice breaker for creative play practitioners, youth workers and in workshops

The game was originally conceived at the Game Jame at CHI '13.

The following is the CHI 2014 paper and study led by Exertion Games Lab, RMIT about i-dentity.

It describes how i-dentity can be used as a tool to inform games designers on how to design for movement based games.

6. Madgwick - this is not included in the source tree and the game can be run without it.
However, Madgwick allows better construction of the quaternion so the controllers can take into account the affect of gravity.

Special thanks to Thomas Perl and his PS Move API who without this game would not be possible.
